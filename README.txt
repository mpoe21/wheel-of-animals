This project presents a simple wheel of animals to spin. Whatever animal the wheel lands on will pop up in the center box with a fun fact. The more times you click the wheel in succession, the faster the wheel will spin. This game is perfect for children learning to read and provides a fun way to learn more about animals. This was created for my Human-Computer Interaction class.
